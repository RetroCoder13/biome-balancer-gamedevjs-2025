In Biome Balancer, your job is to save the displaced animals throughout the world which have been taken from their biomes by robots, therefore restoring balance in nature.\
To do this you can pickup animals and carry them to their native biome which you can find in the compendium.\
Robots are also trying to hinder you by taking animals they find towards the mainframe.\
These robots can be disabled by collecting a keycard somewhere in the map and then walking into the mainframe.

Everytime you play the game, the map is randomly generated along with animal spawns which makes every play different.\
The red dots on the map show animals you are yet to save\
The compendium unlocks itself as you play when you find animals. The more you play, the more animals that are unlocked.
