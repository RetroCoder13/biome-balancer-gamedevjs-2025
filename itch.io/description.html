</p>
<p>In Biome Balancer, your job is to save the displaced animals throughout the world which have been taken from their biomes by robots.
    <br>To do this you can pickup animals and carry them to their native biome which you can find in the compendium.
    <br>Robots are also trying to hinder you by taking animals they find towards the mainframe.
    <br>These robots can be disabled by collecting a keycard somewhere in the map and then walking into the mainframe.
</p>
<p>Everytime you play the game, the map is randomly generated along with animal spawns which makes every play different.
    <br>The compendium unlocks itself as you play when you find animals. The more you play, the more animals that are unlocked.
</p>
<p>WASD to move
    <br>M to toggle the map
    <br>C to toggle the animal compendium
    <br>E to pick up an animal
    <br>R to drop an animal
